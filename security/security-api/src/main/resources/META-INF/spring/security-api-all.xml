		This file's sole purpose is to load all individual context files into
		one big context file to be loaded by the OSGi container. It seems that
		Spring DM has a bug processing multiple context files, so this is a
		workaround to create a single file while still letting the developer
		split bean definitions into multiple files, which is a Spring best
		practice. The typical file loading order is osgi-import, *context,
		osgi-export. But this may have exceptions in certain modules
		(FUR-539).
